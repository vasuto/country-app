### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Install Dependencies

There is preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

The simplest way to start web development server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`].

### Running Unit Tests

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

Or for single run of the tests:

```
npm run test-single-run
```
